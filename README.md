# 3DPrinters
A collection of fundmental 3D Printer Research Papers
This document is formulated to aid me/anyone else who is researching on 3D Printers from a computer science perspective.
Feel free to contact me [jerryant@buffalo.edu] to add anything new to this list. I might take a while to read through the paper first before adding it. Simulated results/data-sets/code/presentation-slides - even better.
