This paper conducts an energy/power analysis of a typical Fused Filament Fabrication(FFF) 3D Printer. The main contributions of this work are:
1. An accurate enough (3% error rate) instruction-level simulator that is able to quantify the power consumption of the a 3D Printing workload.
2. Optimizations (in terms of orientation of the object) that reduces the power consumption in the 3D Printing process.
The authors claim that on average they were able to reduce 25% of the energy consumption for 338 benchmark files.

Overall, this paper sheds light on the energy consumed by the various components of the 3D Printer. The paper inherently assumes a linear power between individual components energy consumption and overall energy consumption. 

Experimental evaluations are done to demonstrate that the approach has no significant overhead in terms of printing time, print quality, etc.
