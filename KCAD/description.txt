This paper is fundamental for detecting malicious errors in 3D Printing.
The paper introduces some fundamental terminologies that could be used for any 3D Printing research.

Description of the work:
1. The model to be printed is assumed to be infected with malicious G-codes.
2. The KCAD defense mechanism identifies the malicious G-codes through a foreknowledge of printing model.

The structural strength of the model printed using KCAD is tested against a model that does not use KCAD. KCAD is able to detect the errornous instructions.
